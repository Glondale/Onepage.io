# Project Overview

## Purpose
Onepage.io is a collection of compact, single-file HTML5 games intended to be easy to host, share, and extend. Each game is a self-contained HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript so it can be dropped onto any static host.

## Goals
- Keep games small and self-contained.
- Provide a simple index for browsing games.
- Encourage clear conceptualization before implementation.

## Conventions
- Directory: place games under `games/` with lowercase hyphenated filenames, e.g. `games/tic-tac-toe.html`.
- Single-file: all CSS/JS must be embedded. No external assets or CDNs.
- Conceptualization: each game must include a comment block at the top describing the concept, controls, and constraints.

## Indexing
- Update `/index.html` to include new games and a short description.
