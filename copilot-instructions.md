# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This codespace is for creating and hosting a series of one-page HTML5 games. The main index will list all available games, and each game will be implemented as a single file containing all code and assets required for gameplay.

## Game Development Guidelines
1. **Game Conceptualization**
   - Before writing any code, fully conceptualize the game. This includes gameplay mechanics, objectives, controls, and visual style.
   - Document the concept clearly before implementation.

2. **Single-File Implementation**
   - Each game must be contained in a single HTML file (including CSS and JavaScript).
   - No external dependencies or assets; everything should be embedded.

3. **Index Page**
   - The index page will serve as a hub, listing and linking to each game.
   - Add new games to the index as they are created.

4. **Hosting and Structure**
   - All files should be organized for easy access and hosting.
   - Use clear naming conventions for game files.

5. **Project Overview Tracking**
   - Maintain `projectoverview.md` with goals, conventions, the index, and a Change log.
   - Whenever you add a game, change repository structure, or update guidelines, update `projectoverview.md` with a short note and the date.
   - Reference `projectoverview.md` in commits and PR descriptions so reviewers and Copilot suggestions are aware of the current project state.

## Workflow
- Conceptualize the game and document the idea.
- Implement the game in a single HTML file.
- Add the game to the index page.
- Test and refine as needed.

- Update `projectoverview.md` with a Change log entry describing the change. Include date, author, and a short description.
- When editing any file, reference `projectoverview.md` for the project information and confirm its Change log is updated.
